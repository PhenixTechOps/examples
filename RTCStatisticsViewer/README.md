#Phenix RTS RTC Stats Viewing Example

# Purpose

This example is used to display video statistics from the [RTCStatistics](https://phenixrts.com/docs/sdk_ref/web/next-gen-channel/#rtcstatistic-video-object) object. This is intended for examples only.

# Instructions

Link the `main.js` file at the bottom of your html page above the `</body>` tag.

`<script src="main.js"></script>`

This needs to be done after the Phenix SDK has been initialized. The reference will need to be the same that is used to create the channel.

This project uses the `channel` reference to subscribe to the statitstics. Modify if needed.
